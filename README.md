**Description**

Empty OS is just its name. I wanted to learn about assembly and bootloaders so I made one. In order to prove that I am not an idiot, I wrote print_string ALL BY MYSELF (just like a big boy).

Empty os has been tested on a VirtualBox VM and on real hardware (ASUS-Nobilis BIOS v904).

On boot, EmptyOS will print some lines of text to the screen. Pressing a key will trigger the secret ending. That is all (so far)

***Requirements***

A PC with an x86 processor

A BIOS that does not require security

A monitor

512 bytes of ram

512 bytes of disk space



Empty OS: Don't get it today
